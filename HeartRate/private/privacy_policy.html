    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-01-01</p>

    <p>
        <strong>PulseFlow</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
        This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We prioritize your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share your personal biometric data on any external servers.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Camera Data (PPG & rPPG)</h3>
    <p>
        PulseFlow uses your device's camera solely for the purpose of measuring your heart rate and physiological stress levels.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Finger Measurement (PPG):</strong> The camera detects color changes in your fingertip to calculate heart rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Face Measurement (rPPG):</strong> The camera analyzes subtle facial skin color changes to estimate pulse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>No video or image data is recorded or saved.</strong> The camera feed is processed in real-time locally on your device to extract signal data, and the raw image data is discarded immediately after processing.
    </p>

    <h3>Health Data</h3>
    <p>
        All measurement results (Heart Rate, HRV, Stress, Energy levels) and history are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using secure local database technologies (such as Isar or Shared Preferences). You have full control over your data and can delete it at any time within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The app requires the following permissions to function:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required to capture the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal for heart rate measurement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The application does not use third-party services to collect or analyze your personal biometric data. 
    </p>

    <h2>4. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        PulseFlow is designed for fitness and wellness purposes only. It is <strong>not a medical device</strong> and should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. If you have any health concerns, please consult a healthcare professional.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data relies on the security of your device. We recommend that you keep your device secure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>
